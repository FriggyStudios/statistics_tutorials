<h1>Ch5: Testing Hypotheses</h1>
<p>##Introduction</p>
<p>The previous chapter illustrated the use of Interval Estimation techniques to provide a range of plausible values for a population parameter based on the corresponding sample statistic and its estimated standard error. The resulting interval allowed statements to be made regarding the likely value of parameters (in particular the mean and median) in the population.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces hypothesis testing as a different option (and complement) to interval estimation. Several of the Illustrations analysed in the previous chapter will be reanalysed using this different approach and the benefits (and lack there of) of hypothesis testing discussed.</p>
<p>A hypothesis test, or statistical test of significance, is a procedure for making formal statements about whether or not a population parameter could conceivably take a particular pre-determined value (often zero!) based on a sample of data from the population.</p>
<div id="section-introduction-the-null-and-alternative-hypotheses" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction The Null and Alternative Hypotheses</h2>
<p>How could it be proved that all male basketball players are taller than 175 cm (5 feet 9 inches)? Even if the heights from a sample of thousands of male basketball players were recorded, and each one was taller than 175 cm, the hypothesis would still not be proven. If on the other hand, a solitary basketball player smaller than 175 cm is found, the hypothesis has been disproved immediately. This example demonstrates that there is a simpler logical framework for disproving hypotheses than for proving them. For this reason, a hypothesis test typically begins by stating the converse of the key hypothesis of interest, called the Null Hypothesis, and attempts to disprove this.</p>
<p>A typical scenario involves the comparison of the mean of two distinct populations (e.g. a simple Between Subject Design with one factor at 2 levels). There are two possibilities under consideration: the population means are equal or the population means are different. Define the two competing hypotheses:</p>
<p>H0: The difference in the population means is zero; H1: The difference in the population means is not zero.</p>
<p>where the first hypothesis Ho is referred to as the Null Hypothesis and the second hypothesis H1 is the Alternative Hypothesis. The Alternative Hypothesis is the hypothesis that must be true if the Null Hypothesis is false.</p>
<p>Both hypotheses are statements relating to population parameters and the object of the procedure is to decide whether the Null Hypothesis should be rejected or not. Rather than try to prove that the Alternative hypothesis is true, the aim is to provide evidence against the Null hypothesis, in favour of a more plausible Alternative.</p>
<p>Measuring Evidence against the Null Hypothesis: Test Statistics and P-Values</p>
<p>What would constitute evidence against the Null hypothesis in the comparison of the mean of two distinct populations? A natural choice for such a test statistic might be the difference in the two sample means. However, both sample means are estimates of their corresponding parameter. Recall from the last chapter that the estimated standard error (ese) provides an estimate as to the precision of the sample statistic, the larger the ese the less precise the statistic is as an estimate of the corresponding parameter. One proposed test statistic, used to provide evidence against the Null Hypothesis in a two-sample comparison of means, involves the ratio of the difference in the two sample means and the ese of the difference in sample means. It is formally defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[t =\displaystyle\frac{difference in sample means}}{ese of the difference in sample means}
\]</span></p>
<p>Numerical values of the t-test statistic distant (i.e. either negatively or positively) from zero suggest that the difference in sample means is large, relative to the combined variability in their estimates; small values close to zero suggest that the sample means were quite close and that their difference is indistinguishable from the variability in their estimates.<br />
A probability (of an event of interest) is always evaluated on a scale from 0 to 1 where the chances of the event of interest happening become more likely as the probability approaches 1 and less and less likely as it approaches 0. An equivalent way of looking at the test statistic above is to consider the probability of observing a more “extreme” value than that actually observed from the data if the samples did arise from populations with the same population mean (i.e. if the Null Hypothesis was true). This probability is referred to as the P-value (‘P’ for probability) and is central in the decision making process in hypothesis testing.</p>
<p>Statistical Significance</p>
<p>The notion of Statistical Significance was introduced in Chapter 1 to represent an observed effect that was ‘unlikely to have occurred by chance’. This is formalised in the hypothesis testing paradigm by determining when a P-value is small enough to warrant rejecting the Null Hypothesis. The choice of such a “small enough value” is known as the Significance Level and is traditionally set at 0.05, so that a P-value less than or equal to 0.05 is thought to provide enough evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis. In such a case, then the data are said to have produced a ‘statistically significant’ conclusion and a decision is made to reject the Null Hypothesis.</p>
<p>The Illustration on Soccer Fitness, introduced previously in Chapters 3 and 4, involved a comparison of two population means. A 95% Confidence Interval for the difference in population mean CMJ Height (Seniors minus Youths) ranged from 3.05 to 10.13 cm (Box 4.3.1) providing evidence of a higher mean CMJ Height in the population of Senior soccer players. It may be rightly claimed that conclusion has been achieved by virtue of the 95% CI providing a credible range for the parameter of interest, namely the difference in the population means. This interval did not contain zero implying that the population means are significantly different.</p>
What is a hypothesis test adding to the evidence provided by the interval estimate? The answer is nothing! Historically hypothesis testing was used before interval estimation ideas were ‘developed’ and, although it adds little, the approach is still used extensively in Sports and Exercise Science - often pointlessly as in this example. There are, however, a number of scenarios where it is useful – for example in the ideas of Model Choice introduced in later chapters. Although hypothesis testing is, strictly speaking, unnecessary for the examples presented here, it is useful to introduce the basic idea here rather than in more complicated situations where interval estimation is much less effective or indeed even ‘impossible’.
